    "\n",
    "•\tPython uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of the number of references to an object in memory. When an object is no longer being used by the program, the memory manager automatically frees up the memory occupied by that object. Additionally, Python also uses a garbage collector to periodically scan the heap for objects that are no longer referenced by the program, and frees up the memory occupied by those objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOne important thing to note is that in Python, you do not have direct control over the allocation and deallocation of memory. This is in contrast to some low-level languages like C and C++, where you need to manually allocate and deallocate memory using functions such as malloc and free. In Python, you simply create objects and let the memory manager handle the rest.\n",
